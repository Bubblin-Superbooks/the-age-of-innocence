we?" he insisted, looking down at her; and suddenly he broke out:
"Haven't we done all we could?"</p><p>"Oh"â€”she murmured again.  She stood up and reopened her sunshade,
glancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure
herself of the impossibility of remaining in it.  Then her eyes
returned to his face.  "You mustn't say things like that to me," she
said.</p><p>"I'll say anything you like; or nothing.  I won't open my mouth unless
you tell me to.  What harm can it do to anybody?  All I want is to
listen to you," he stammered.</p><p>She drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enamelled chain.  "Oh,
don't calculate," he broke out; "give me the day!  I want to get you
away from that man.  At what time was he coming?"</p><p>Her colour rose again.  "At eleven."</p><p>"Then you must come at once."</p></div> </div>
