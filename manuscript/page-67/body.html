Archers.</p><p>Mrs. Archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked to
be well-informed as to its doings.  Her old friend Mr. Sillerton
Jackson applied to the investigation of his friends' affairs the
patience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and his

brought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in
his picture.</p></div> </div>
