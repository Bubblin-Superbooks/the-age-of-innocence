her, almost heard her, stealing up behind him to throw her light arms
about his neck.  While he waited, soul and body throbbing with the
miracle to come, his eyes mechanically received the image of a
heavily-coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing
along the path to the house.  The man was Julius Beaufort.</p><p>"Ah—!" Archer cried, bursting into a laugh.</p><p>Madame Olenska had sprung up and moved to his side, slipping her hand
into his; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she
shrank back.</p><p>"So that was it?" Archer said derisively.</p><p>"I didn't know he was here," Madame Olenska murmured.  Her hand still
clung to Archer's; but he drew away from her, and walking out into the
passage threw open the door of the house.</p><p>"Hallo, Beaufort—this way!  Madame Olenska was expecting you," he said.</p></div> </div>
