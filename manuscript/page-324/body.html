and spread over her neck and shoulders.  She blushed seldom and
painfully, as if it hurt her like a burn.</p><p>"Many cruel things have been believed of me," she said.</p><p>"Oh, Ellenâ€”forgive me; I'm a fool and a brute!"</p><p>She smiled a little.  "You are horribly nervous; you have your own
troubles.  I know you think the Wellands are unreasonable about your

understand our long American engagements; I suppose they are not as
