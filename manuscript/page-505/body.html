<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>These points had been raised, as usual, at Mrs. Archer's Thanksgiving
dinner.  At the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks
for the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful
though not embittered stock of her world, and wonder what there was to
be thankful for.  At any rate, not the state of society; society, if it
could be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down
Biblical imprecationsâ€”and in fact, every one knew what the Reverend
Dr. Ashmore meant when he chose a text from Jeremiah (chap. ii., verse
25) for his Thanksgiving sermon.  Dr. Ashmore, the new Rector of St.
Matthew's, had been chosen because he was very "advanced": his sermons
were considered bold in thought and novel in language.  When he
fulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its "trend";
and to Mrs. Archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel
herself part of a community that was trending.</p></div> </div>
