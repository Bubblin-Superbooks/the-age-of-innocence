to worry Mamma by raising fresh obstacles; but how can you meet Ellen
tomorrow, and bring her back to New York, when you're going to
Washington?"</p><p>"Oh, I'm not going," Archer answered.</p><p>"Not going?  Why, what's happened?"  Her voice was as clear as a bell,
and full of wifely solicitude.</p><p>"The case is off—postponed."</p><p>"Postponed?  How odd!  I saw a note this morning from Mr. Letterblair
to Mamma saying that he was going to Washington tomorrow for the big
patent case that he was to argue before the Supreme Court.  You said it
was a patent case, didn't you?"</p><p>"Well—that's it: the whole office can't go.  Letterblair decided to go
this morning."</p><p>"Then it's NOT postponed?" she continued, with an insistence so unlike
her that he felt the blood rising to his face, as if he were blushing
for her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies.</p></div> </div>
